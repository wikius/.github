# Projects
Our areas of focus include Wiki × AI; scaling Wikidata; citation tools; GLAM tools; editor recruitment and diversity. 
Currently under discussion and development:

Wiki x AI:
* [Omnipedia](http://www.omnipedia.cc/): using the Manual of Style to automate article review – LLM tools for turning MoS pages into requirements, and for evaluating articles against those requirments, by sentence and by section.  Presentations at AI Palace and EMNLP 2024.
* [Waikiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Waikiki) hackathon series: Wiki×AI tools and toolchains

Scaling Wikidata:
* [Benchmarking Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Scaling_Wikidata/Benchmarking) - setting up an independent community-run server for testing QLever, Virtuoso, and other alternate backends for Wikidata.  Initial report planned for January 2025
* 100&Change proposal for scaling the sum of all human knowledge: _Curate locally, query globally_ 

Citation tools:
* Past projects + related programs: [WikiCred](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCred) microgrants, [Reliable Sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vaccine_safety/Perennial_sources) project
* Planned project: LLM tool to automate citation checking and validation
* Potential future projects: Adding missing scholarly metadata to the new [scholarly wikibase in Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/WDQS_graph_split), and turning into a full-fledged [WikiCite](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WikiCite_poster_2011.pdf) project.

GLAM tools:
* Past projects + related programs: extensive Wikimedians in Residence at the Met, Smithsonian, National Archives, &c.  WikiPortraits.
* Potential future project: Fellowship program for GLAM tool designers

Editor recruitment:
* Planned project: Education and engagement of Black US Wikipedians, with AfroCrowd and WikiEdu 
* Support for annual events: WLM, Wiknic, WikiPortraits
* Potential future projects: University ambassador program, Stammtisch kits

# Projects we like
_and that have helped plan or implement some of these projects_

* Wikiconference North America, an annual conference that has helped seed and organize many of these projects
* Wikimedia NYC and Wikimedia DC, the two Wikimedia chapters in the US, which host or incubate many projects not listed above and run many of their own
* Wiki Education ([wikiedu](https://wikiedu.org/)), which has run hundreds of courses and outreach events for thousands of students across the US (and maintains their own excellent [dashboard](https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/))  
* Wikicred, a proposed user group focused on credibility tools which has distributed over $200k in microgrants, organized a few events, and runs regular office hours introducing them to the community
* Hacks/Hackers, a tech + journalism non-profit and incubator that has been the fiscal sponsor and facilitator for many wiki and credibility programs, including WikiCred and WCNA 2019
* The [Community Data Science Collective](https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page), an interdisciplinary research group with wiki nous and intergalactic insight
* [Shared Citations](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite/Shared_Citations), an extremely well-described project designed by Liam Wyatt and others, which was well received by the community but has not been pursued.
* [Scholia](https://scholia.toolforge.org/statistics), a scholarly-research discovery tool that is the most-used interface to Wikidata after the official Query Service.
* Underlay, a framework for sharing composable, provenanced data, used for capturing attestations of reliability in the Reliable Sources project.
* Future House, and their [WikiCrow](https://wikicrow.ai/) project working on accelerating the production of wiki-style knowledge
* Block Science, working on [languages for knowledge networks](https://blog.block.science/a-language-for-knowledge-networks/) and the Omnipedia prototype
